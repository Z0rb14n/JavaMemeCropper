# JavaMemeCropper
Cropper of memes - you may need to hard code files though.

## Getting Started
To run the program,
1. Change the image directory paths in MemeCropper.java to /path/to/images/ and /path/to/cropped/images/location/.
2. Run MemeCropper.Main.

### Prerequisites
This project requires Java 8 or newer. I have tested this on a Mac OS X 10.10 operating system using Java 8, and I have no guarantees on whether this will run on other OSes or older versions of Java.
